# HTTP portfolio

## 1. Write code that executes asynchronously

We used asynchronous JavaScript when fetching data for our project, which displays data relating to countries around the world, including population, currency, land size, capital city, etc. 


## 2. Use callbacks to access values that aren't available synchronously



## 3. Use promises to access values that aren't available synchronously



## 4. Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses

A separate JavaScript file in our project, consisting of a function called fetchData, used the fetch method to get responses from our two APIs.

## 5. Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests



## 6. Use the map array method to create a new array containing new values



## 7. Use the filter array method to create a new array with certain values removed



## 8. Access DOM nodes using a variety of selectors

## 9. Add and remove DOM nodes to change the content on the page

Our generateElement JS file not only accessed DOM nodes, but also added and removed them, as you can see in the image below. We created list and paragraph elements, and set attribute and class lists within those elements. In addition, we also appended data in the created list elements.

## 10. Toggle the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties

As you can see with the screenshot in #9 above, we also created a createLoader function, whose purposes was to gave a visual clue to the user of the website when data was being fetched after the user entered in the name of a country. The function toggled the classes applied to DOM nodes to change their CSS properties. This can be seen in action in the screenshot below, which is what comes up when the user clicks search after entering in a country in the Search bar.

## 11. Use consistent layout and spacing



## 12. Follow a spacing guideline to give our app a consistent feel



## 13. Debug client side JS in our web browser



## 14. Use console.log() to help us debug our code
