## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility

This screenshot shows that we incorporated semantic elements in our HTML, including demarcating each section so that it can be tabbed through by the user, as well as H1 and H2 headings in correct order, which ensured that they would be read out by a screen reader (see below). In addition, we used alt-tags on each image.
Being able to tab through the site is especially important for those with sight access requirements, and relates to the below.
Unfortunately, we missed using ARIA-labels, which was a glaring omission. 

## 2. Make a web page more readable for screen readers

After incorporating the semantic elements in point 1, I then tested the site via screen readers such as Windows Narrator, Speechify, and NVDA. The site worked well with the first two, but came up against issues with NVDA, which appeared to not be able to read the semantic HTML well. 

## 3. Design a UI without relying solely on colour, so that we donâ€™t exclude colour-blind users

## 4. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

The screen shot above in Item #3 above confims that we built the site with the express purposes of it being accessible for users whether colour blind or not.

## 5. Use various tools to check that a website meets accessibility criteria

We ran the HTML through https://validator.w3.org, which is a practice that I used regularly while studying the Advanced Web Authoring module of Birkbeck (indeed, a condition of gaining a high mark there was for the HTML to validate correctly). However, we came up against a number of problems when doing this. The validator flags up trailing slashes on void elements as bad for validation, yet Visual Studio Code (unless I am mistaken) appears to add these trailing slashes automatically.

In addition, when running the site directly from LiveServer, the Lighthouse function in Chrome confusingly claimed that there were no alt-tags for the images, even though there were, and gave us 91% for Accessibility accordingly.

## 6. Ensure a website displays well on screens of different sizes

By using HTML elements that naturally adjust to different screen sizes as well as specific styles such as max-width: 100% on images, our page was responsive.

## 7. Use CSS media queries to ensure content is always presented effectively

We not consider that we needed CSS media queries for this project, as it already scaled well.

## 8. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to designing a website with a great user experience

Our commits show our mobile-first approach. This is in acknowledgement of the fact that many users increasingly access websites via mobile phone and tablets.

## 9. Create an attractive and accessible colour palette for a project

We used colour sparingly on the site. There is a black navigation bar, with links in white font colour; then the main section of the site has black font colour against a background of a sombre white/gray ```(#eee8e8)```. Meanwhile, for the biography section, we used a blend of blue, pink, and green to to lift the rider biography cards from the page. 

## 10. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements
